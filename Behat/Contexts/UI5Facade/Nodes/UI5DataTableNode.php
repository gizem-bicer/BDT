     * methods (selectRow / ensureExactlySelectedRows) on top of it prevents call sites from
     * accidentally deselecting a row they meant to select.
     *
     * Why getTableRows() is used instead of an own DOM query:
     * The previous implementation matched `.sapUiTableTr, .sapMListTblRow` directly, which
     * also matches the rows of the fixed-column table. That list is longer than - and in a
     * different order from - the one getLoadedRowCount() and every other row helper works
     * with, so row number N could point at a different physical row depending on which
     * helper asked. Sharing one row list keeps row numbers, selection state and click
     * targets in a single consistent index space.
     *
     * WHY THE OUTCOME IS READ BACK: the previous version clicked and assumed success. A click
     * selects nothing in several ordinary configurations - a data cell where the widget reacts only
     * to the row selector, an editable cell that enters edit mode, a cell holding a link or button
     * that fires that instead. The failure was silent and surfaced far away as "no loaded row shows
     * this button", so working buttons were reported as skipped. Reading the state back through
     * getSelectedRowNumbers() - the single source of truth - turns that into an immediate failure.
     *
     * WHY DESELECTION CAN BE A NO-OP: deselection only exists where an explicit selector is
     * rendered. On a single-select table whose only path is the row body, clicking a selected row
     * leaves it selected - the widget offers no deselection. A deselect request there must neither
     * click nor fail; correctness is guaranteed instead by ensureExactlySelectedRows() comparing the

     * Refines the generic, model-only matching of the parent (see

     *
     * The parent returns the FIRST column whose attribute matches the filter attribute - either
     * exactly, or via the LABEL/relation-path heuristic (endsWith). When several columns can match
     * the same filter attribute - e.g. a foreign-key column plus the related LABEL column, or two
     * columns showing the same relation under different captions - that first match can be a column
     * that is not rendered as a header in the DOM, even though a matching, rendered column exists.
     * The caption of the non-rendered column is then handed to verifyTableContent(), which fails
     * with "Column '...' not found in table" although the filter itself worked. This is exactly the
     * "the code thinks it found the column, but the column is not actually in the table" problem.
     *
     * This override collects every model candidate and returns the best one, preferring in order:
     *   1. an exact attribute match whose caption is actually rendered as a header,
     *   2. a fuzzy (LABEL/relation) match whose caption is rendered,
     *   3. an exact match (even if not rendered),
     *   4. a fuzzy match (even if not rendered).
     * So the returned column is the one the content verification can locate whenever such a column
     * exists, while the previous behaviour is preserved as the fallback when nothing is rendered.
